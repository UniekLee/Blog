This afternoon we stopped in at Corfe Castle. It's an old castle that now lies in ruin, but the adjacent Corfe town is absolutely beautiful.<!--more-->

We spent our time walking around the town and then sat down for sweet tea - tea and scones with clotted cream and strawberry jam. It was rather yummy, to say the least! The tea garden also had a spectacular view of the castle.
