The alliterative titles are back! Woo hoo!

This morning saw us taking a trip out the the Durdle Door. It's a natural limestone archway right on the coast in the middle of a pair of beautiful beaches.

Our morning outing took a scenic drive out to the Durdle Door and a long walk along the adjacent beach. It's a beautiful sight and a lovely, sheltered peddle beach.

There isn't much more to say about it than that, so I'll let the pictures say the rest.
